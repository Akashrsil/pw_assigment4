        <h1>Features of HTML 5</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <h3> 1.Native Multimedia Support</h3>
        <p>HTML5 introduced native support for embedding audio and video content directly into web pages using the
            audio and video elements. This eliminates the need for third-party plugins like Flash, making it easier
            to integrate multimedia content into websites.
            The audio and video elements provide APIs for controlling playback, volume, and other features
            programmatically, allowing developers to create custom multimedia experiences without
            relying on external plugins.</p>
        <h3>Canvas</h3>
        <p>HTML5 introduced the canvas element, which allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D graphics, charts,
            animations, and games directly within the browser without the need for plugins.</p>
        <h3>Improved Semantics and Accessibility</h3>
        <p> HTML5 introduced new semantic elements such as
            header,
            footer, nav, article, section, and aside, which provide better structure and meaning to web
            documents.</p>
        <p>Semantic elements help improve accessibility by providing clearer cues about the purpose and organization of
            content, making it easier for screen readers and other assistive technologies to interpret web pages.</p>
        <p>The improved semantics of HTML5 also benefit search engine optimization (SEO) by providing search engines
            with better context and understanding of web page content, leading to improved rankings and visibility in
            search results.</p>
